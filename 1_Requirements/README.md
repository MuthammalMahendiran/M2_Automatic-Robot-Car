# REQUIREMENTS

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
* SIMULIDE
* WINAVR

## COMPONENETS USED IN PROJECT
* DC motor
      
 DC motor is connected to microcontroller and it will rotate forward, backward,left and right directions autmatically.
          
* ATmega328 microcontroller
      
The commands are sent to the ATmega328 microcontroller  which serves as the main control of the robot car, as it controls the car movement. The implemented robot car was rotate successfully .

## 4'WS and 1 H:

#### Who
This Automatic robot car   is  an application is used by all the people especially childrean .

####  What:
This project  is navigated and maneuvered by a computer without a need for human control or intervention under a range of driving situations and conditions.

####  When:
This Automatic robot car  is very useful when there are large no of people used robot car .

#### Where:
The robot car  is nowadays essential for all the  places .

####  How:
This project is implemented for to be  moving  in forward, backward, left and right directions automatically.
