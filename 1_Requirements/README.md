# AUTOMATIC ROBOT CAR

## INTRODUCTION

The aim of this project is to use  micro-controller with the DC motor with the view of making the robot follow certain commands.It should contain two  motors for the movement of the robotic car. Consider clockwise as forward and anticlockwise as backward. This project is designed using Embedded C programming language and it should be  compiled in Atmel studio with the GCC compiler.The simulation is done in Simulide.

### COMMANDS: 

* FORWARD
* BACKWARD
* LEFT
* RIGHT
* STOP

The car will be moving automatically according to these directions.
## PROPERTIES 

# Dc motor 
A direct current (DC) motor is a type of electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. DC motors take electrical power through direct current, and convert this energy into mechanical rotation.

# ATmega328

The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.
