# AUTOMATIC ROBOT CAR

## INTRODUCTION

The aim of this project is to use  micro-controller with the DC motor with the view of making the robot follow certain commands.It should contain two  motors for the movement of the robotic car. Consider clockwise as forward and anticlockwise as backward. This project is designed using Embedded C programming language and it should be  compiled in Atmel studio with the GCC compiler.The simulation is done in Simulide.

### COMMANDS: 

* FORWARD
* BACKWARD
* LEFT
* RIGHT
* STOP

The car will be moving automatically according to these directions.
