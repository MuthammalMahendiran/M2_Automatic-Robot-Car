# AUTOMATIC ROBOT CAR

## INTRODUCTION

The aim of this project is to use  micro-controller with the DC motor with the view of making the robot follow certain commands.It should contain two  motors for the movement of the robotic car. Consider clockwise as forward and anticlockwise as backward. This project is designed using Embedded C programming language and it should be  compiled in WinAVR with the GCC compiler.The simulation is done in Simulide.

### COMMANDS: 

* FORWARD
* BACKWARD
* LEFT
* RIGHT
* STOP

The car will be moving automatically according to these directions.

## OBJECTIVE

 The main objective of this project is to move a car in all direction without the  need for human direction or any other  interaction.
## PROPERTIES 

#### Dc motor 
A direct current (DC) motor is a type of electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. DC motors take electrical power through direct current, and convert this energy into mechanical rotation.

#### ATmega328

The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.

## 4'WS and 1 H:

#### Who
This Automatic robot car   is  an application is used by all the people especially childrean .

####  What:
This project  is navigated and maneuvered by a computer without a need for human control or intervention under a range of driving situations and conditions.

####  When:
This Automatic robot car  is very useful when there are large no of people used robot car .

#### Where:
The robot car  is nowadays essential for all the  places .

####  How:
This project is implemented for to be  moving  in forward, backward, left and right directions automatically.
