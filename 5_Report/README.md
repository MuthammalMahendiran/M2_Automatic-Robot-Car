#### Dc motor 
A direct current (DC) motor is a type of electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. DC motors take electrical power through direct current, and convert this energy into mechanical rotation.

A DC motor is one of the first electric motors designed to convert direct current electrical energy to mechanical energy. It is one of the greatest devices that humans invented and since then, it has amazingly revolutionized our lives. This rotary electrical machine occupied different types, all of them contain almost the same components that cooperate based on either the mechanism of electronic or the mechanism of electromechanical that is responsible for changing the direction of current in the motor.

A DC motor is made up of a stator, an armature or a rotor, and a commutator with brushes. These are main components and are included in all the DC motors. If we want to explain very briefly how this type of engine works, we must say that the polarity opposition between the two magnetic fields of the motor causes it to turn. These motors may be the simplest motors available in terms of construction and performance, but they have a wide range of uses, including those used in home appliances such as electric razors and those used in a variety of industries.

#### ATmega328

The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.Tmega328 is an Advanced Virtual RISC (AVR) microcontroller. It supports 8-bit data processing. ATmega-328 has 32KB internal flash memory. ATmega328 has 1KB Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM).
